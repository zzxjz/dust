## Prebuilt binaries

[![Binary release build status](https://github.com/kelpsyberry/dust/actions/workflows/build-release.yml/badge.svg?branch=main&event=push)](https://github.com/kelpsyberry/dust/actions/workflows/build-release.yml?query=branch%3Amain+event%3Apush)
[![macOS app bundle release build status](https://github.com/kelpsyberry/dust/actions/workflows/build-release-macos-app-bundles.yml/badge.svg?branch=main&event=push)](https://github.com/kelpsyberry/dust/actions/workflows/build-release-macos-app-bundles.yml?query=branch%3Amain+event%3Apush)

- The base configuration only includes all features necessary to run games as an end user
- The debugging configuration additionally enables logging of diagnostic events on the emulated system (i.e. invalid I/O device usage or port accesses) and several debugging views (i.e. memory and register viewer and a disassembly view), all accessible from the Debug menu
- The debugging + GDB server configuration also enables support for a GDB client to attach to and debug the emulated program, by starting/stopping the server from the Debug menu while running a program

> **NB**: The debugging configurations only add debugging features for loaded programs; all binaries are compiled with optimizations and don't include debug symbols for the emulator itself.
